## Lab

Fork and clone this repository. 

Run `learn` from within the cloned directory and your tests will fail.

Open the file `lib/a_working_program.rb` and fix the error.

The entire contents of the file should read:

```ruby
puts "Hello World"
```

Save the file, run `learn` and it should pass. Commit your changes and push then open a pull request and it should be all green.
