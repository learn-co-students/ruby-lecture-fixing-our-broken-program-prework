# What is a Program?

puts "This is a program"
puts "Programs are interpreted at runtime."
puts "Which means even though I'm writing this Tue Jan 17 2012 8:36am"
puts "the time now is "+ Time.now.to_s

puts "Programs have flow."
puts "Which means that you see this first"
puts "and this next."

puts "Lines of code are executed linearly, that's flow."
puts "First come, first served."

puts "Programs are composed of basically three things:"

puts "A language's keywords, like 'if' or 'end' (approximately 43)."
puts "Literal pieces of data like this very sentence (or String)."
puts "Finally, barewords, or variables, that are set equal to things."

puts "Anything that isn't one of those will cause an error."
